Um, and something I've been thinking about a lot is like, okay, how do you perform evangelism in the postmodern age, you know? Um, and I genuinely just need to look into like the history of what evangelism has looked like um because I I don't think it's been, you know, fire and brimstone the whole time. That's very very much like a, I would say like, 19th and 20th century Baptist type thing. Um, I just need I I need and and like, you know, the uncontacted tribe thing is a whole different thing. Shit, I'm going the wrong way. Um, it's it's a whole it's a whole different thing. Um, I I I I I just need to look into it. Um, but something that's something I've been thinking about. Like what is a quote unquote strategy that, oh my gosh, I can't make a turn! Um, what's a quote unquote like strategy for like missionary-ism because everybody's skeptical, everybody's cynical. Like if you try to pull a a fire and brimstone missionary thing or hold up a sign that says, you deserve hell but Jesus paid for the price, or like a basic Billy Graham gospel thing, no one people, people with an IQ of between frankly, above like 105 aren't going to be interested, you know? Uh, which is a fair amount of people, um, in the US. Uh, and like e- frankly, even like 95 or some the IQ thing is fake, but you know what I mean. Like, you're relatively somewhat smart, uh, you're cynical. You're cynical is the word that I'm looking looking for and everybody's cynical nowadays. Everybody's cynical, everybody's skeptical, everybody's a quote unquote rationalist, what freaking ever. And it's like how how how do you engage with that? Because there are ways to engage with that as a Christian. Um, they're difficult and time-consuming and fundamentally challenge the way that we conceive of how things work. That was the worst U-turn I've ever made. Um, but they've fundamentally like you can't fit Christianity into modern materialism, um, and the lack of spiritual stuff, because we've tried that. Um, what Anglo-Saxon Protestantism, mainline churches tried that, and it's not turning out well for them. They're dying off right now. And it's also not Christianity. Um, so you can't do it by like synchronizing. Uh, you can't do it by appealing to them and saying, oh you can fit Christianity Christian- Christianity into your worldview. You kind of need to challenge that and say like, there is the spiritual, there's something that's you you can't be a purely like the purely rational man is a fake thing that's developed by fake people to jerk themselves off. Um, and there's something beyond that and it's not it's it's not emotionalism. It's not rationality in some sense. Um, it's something else. And it's something that we've lost. And it's something that I'm figuring out right now. Um, and it's something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about. Uh, and yeah, I don't I don't know. Um, sorry, that got off on a bit of a incoherent rant. But like, you know, what strategy do you do for like the 20th for the 20-something-year-old bisexual New Yorker? Like how do you evangelize to them? Um, is that something that can even be done? I don't know. Like, would you be able to engage them at their level? What I'm I'm going to talk for this whole drive. I'm sorry, but it it's like three minutes away. Um, like, if you engage with it at their level, it's like, okay, here's the following proofs. I think the best way to go about doing that would be like, okay, here's a proof for the resurrection. Go! Go! Um, like, oh, here's here's a proof for the resurrection, you know? It's um, uh, here's the best case against the resurrection, which is here, watch this Gavin Ortlund video, um, which is like, you know, uh, the grave theft plus hallu- hallucinations, like the disciples stole the body and there was also some hallucina- collective hallucination and deception going on. Um, and show how that doesn't square up. I'm not going to explain it now because that takes forever. Um, but like, you you you know, engage with them at that. But first of all, that's uh, you kind of reach an intellectual barrier at that point, um, to where like you kind of need to A, have a long period of time, B, an attention span that will like to the other person where like they're actively engaging with this and they're active like, you're not just handing them a tract or anything, and you're not just like saying a paragraph and then they come to Jesus. Like this is an intellectual discussion that you're having that takes place at the very least over like 10 minutes. Um, and that's if you keep their um, attention. That's if they have the time, that's if they have the intellectual capacity to understand your arguments, um, that's if they have the historical knowledge to realize how we do history. Um, like there's there's so much that you would need to explain, uh, in order to do that. And even then, Christianity isn't intellectually believing that, um, like it's true, you know? Christianity isn't intellectually believing that the resurrection happened. It's believing that the resurrection happened and he died for your sins and that you have sinned and that he took that penalty and that you can live only in Christ. Um, that's, you know, the gospel. Uh, and like, you know, there's a certain level of like heart, a certain level of spirituality, a certain level of, uh, swallowing your pride for a bit. What the fuck? Sorry, there's not a stop sign at that little spot, but he was acting as if it was a stop, which it should be a stop, frankly. Um, why is there traffic in the Culver's parking lot? What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are we doing here? What's going on here? What are we doing? What are we doing? You could scoot the flip up. There we go. Look, look, look, look at what Gosh. What's going on here, guys? What's going on? Sorry, I'm crashing out right now because it's really funny. Um, but what are we doing here? What are we doing here, guys? Is this, are we, is this really the freaking drive-through? Are we all in line for the drive-through? Are we all in line for the drive-through here? Is that what we're freaking doing? Are we all in line for the I I can't I can't I can't make this turn? What are we doing? What are we doing? Can can I Okay, breaking the law here. Let's go. Um, okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. Um, horrible parking job, but that's kind of how I had to do this. Um, but yeah, I don't know. I didn't reach a conclusion there. I'm sorry. You need, uh, conclusion, you need to make people realize that, um, rationality, like pure rationality or pure pure 20th century hypermodernism is not the way to do things, and it's, uh, ultimately foundationless, and you can't build anything off of it. Um, and you need to build then and something off of it, uh, to be human and to function properly and to live any sense of life. Uh, so you either make something up or you look at something that seems to be real, you know? Um, I don't know. I don't know."

I don't know. Um, like it it it it looks interesting, but I'm forgetting what it's about because I'm very tired. Speaking of which, because I'm very tired, put this on my leg. Because I'm very tired, uh, and I'm driving on I-95 right now, uh, going, it's, well, now 75 because the car ahead of me slowed down, but I'm going fast. Um, trying to get home, and I'm on a caffeine crash, four hours of sleep. Uh, I'm going to do this to keep me awake. So, um, I've been thinking about uh, the law. I've been thinking about the law and its relation to um, to Christianity. And like how as Christians are we to be abiders of the law? Uh, because we should. We should abide, I think it's pretty clear biblically that we should abide the law um, as long as it's not like against some Christian principle. Uh, and I think it's a good thing to like outline this, to outline exactly how we interact with the law, is speeding. Um, for instance, like if you're, uh, driving your friends to the hospital, um, and he's gonna die unless you get there in like five minutes, and it's six minutes away. Like you can speed there, you know, like that's fine. You can do that because ultimately this takes precedent over the don't, over the follow the law thing. Um, follow the law only when it, you know, is within the bounds of Christian morality. Um, but how do we, like, what is law in that case? Because there's kind of like, you know, there's the idea of, okay, law is what's, okay, there, basically there's like two different ideas of what law is, I think. Um, and one is that it's whatever's written down officially on the piece of paper by the government. And then the other idea is that it's whatever uh, authority decides in that moment. Um, and I don't really know which to choose. You know? Um, because I think like a convincing argument can be made that like, if a law isn't enforced, then it isn't law, you know? Uh, like something may be technically in the law, but if it's not enforced, like all that is is just a sheet of paper signed by somebody. Like, that's not the government enforcing the law, you know? Like that's, I don't, I I don't know like how we're supposed to take that realm of officiality as like official. I don't know. Basically, when it comes to speeding and stuff, right? Like if you go 80 on a 70, that's breaking the law, you know, in that sense, but at least here, zero cops are going to pull you over for that. Like, I'm going 80 right now. I've gone very fast before. Um, and I've I've been pulled over once and that was not even for speeding. That was for having my headlights off at night accidentally. Um, so like, you know, if you're going 80 on a 70, is that a sin? you know? Because you're technically breaking the law, and they technically have warrant to pull you over, but they won't. They won't. The law isn't being enforced. So, what do you abide by here? Do you abide by, um, like the police officer, do do you abide by the police officer um, who doesn't pull you over? Like, is he the law in this case? Is the police officer the law and the enforcement of government things? Or is the piece of paper that says this stuff the law? you know? Like, I don't know."

Um, because as I understand it, you kind of see like two big groups getting, quote unquote, getting all the converts. Um, and it's yet again, the charismatic non-denominational churches. Can we please get past this, America? Can we please get past this in the west? Um, I really, really don't like it. Um, and then you have like trad cats and to a lesser extent Orthodox Christians and to a significantly lesser extent traditional Protestant churches, which I think is the best. Um, so, like we'll see which one like wins out in a sense in defining the movement. Um, we'll see if it's another like Billy Graham, Calvary Chapel, simple gospel, charismatic type thing, or if it turns into this weird, not neo-orthodox, because that's a whole separate thing, but like, you know, a return to tradition in an interesting way that's different from the past. Um, we'll see. I'm hoping for the latter, honestly, but I'm kind of scared if it goes to the latter because that might involve a lot of racism and far-rightness and weirdness. Um, but I don't know, man. I don't know. Um, that was like two of my points. I don't know. Another point, revivals are just kind of weird in general and they're never perfect, they're never close to perfect. Um, the closest we had to perfect was like the second generation of reformers. Um, and then that's it. That's probably not true, but like I like that and kind of since that point in America, we've just been drifting further and further from what I believe is right doctrine. Um, I personally blame Charles Wesley, and then also whoever that guy who invented dispensationalism. Um, I don't know. I don't like the restoration. I don't like, I don't like these great awakenings, if I'm being honest. However, they do get Christians. But it's weaker Christians, and I don't know, man, we got to figure this out in the west. Like, we got to figure this out because we can't keep going in this circle of revival after revival, getting continually theologically worse. Um, so I really hope that this next revival breaks that pattern and we see something different. Even if it is like a revival that's temporary, like if we can break the chain of getting more and more decentralized and more and more breaking from tradition, and more and more charismatic and personality-based, and more and more separate from theology, like, if we could break that, that would be awesome, you know? So I'm kind of rooting for the Trad Cats, but also that's its, that's its own beast. We'll see what happens with it, basically. Like, I don't know. I'll update my thoughts as things happen and as trends happen. Like, I'm interested to see where this orthodox thing goes, even though it's 90% going nowhere. Um, it's still interesting. It's still interesting."

Then he shall wash his clothes and his clothes and bathe his body in water and he shall be clean."

Um, and something I've been thinking about a lot is like, okay, how do you perform evangelism in the post-modern age, you know? Um, and I genuinely just need to look into like the history of what evangelism has looked like. Um, because like, I don't think it's been, you know, fire and brimstone the whole time. That's very, very much like a, I'd say like 19th and 20th century Baptist type thing. Um, I just, I need, and like, you know, the uncontacted tribe thing is a whole different thing. Shit, I'm going the wrong way. Um, it's, it's a whole, it's a whole different thing. Um, I, I, I, I just need to look into it. Um, but something that's something I've been thinking about, like what is a quote-unquote strategy? Oh my gosh, I can't make it turn. Um, what's a quote-unquote like strategy for like missionary-ism? Because everybody's skeptical. Everybody's cynical. Like, if you try to pull, uh, fire and brimstone missionary thing, or hold up a sign that says, you know, you deserve hell, but Jesus paid for the price, or like a basic Billy Graham gospel thing. No, people, people with an IQ of between, frankly, above like 105, aren't gonna be interested, you know? Uh, which is a fair amount of people. Um, in the US. Uh, and like, frankly, even like 95 or something, the IQ thing is fake. But you know what I mean. Like, you're relatively somewhat smart. Uh, you're cynical. You're cynical is the word that I'm looking for. And everybody's cynical nowadays. Everybody's cynical, everybody's skeptical, everybody's of quote-unquote rationalist, once freaking ever. And it's like, how, how do you engage with that? Because there are ways to engage with that as a Christian. Um, they're difficult and time-consuming and fundamentally challenged the way that we conceive of how things work. That was a worst U-turn I've ever made. Um, they fundamentally, like, you can't fit Christianity into modern materialism, um, and the lack of spiritual stuff, because we've tried that. Um, like Anglo-Saxon Protestantism, mainline churches tried that, and it's not turning out well for them. They're dying off right now. And it's also not Christianity. Um, so you can't do it by like synchronizing. Uh, you can't do it by appealing to them and saying, oh, you can fit Christianity, Christianity into your worldview. You kind of need to challenge that and say like, there is the spiritual. There's something that's, you can't be a purely like the purely rational man is a fake thing, uh, some of it by fake people to jerk themselves off. Um, and there's something beyond that. And it's not, it's, it's not emotionalism. It's not rationality in some sense. Um, it's something else. And it's something that we've lost. And it's something that I'm figuring out right now. Um, and it's something I've been spending a lot of time thinking about. Uh, and yeah, I don't, I don't know. Um, sorry, that got off on a bit of a incoherent rant. But like, he, you know, what strategy do you do for like the 20th for the 20 something year old, bisexual New Yorker? Like, how do you evangelize to them? Um, is that something that can even be done? I don't know. Like, would you be able to engage them at their level? What, I'm, I'm gonna talk for this whole drive. I'm sorry, but it's like three minutes away. Um, like, if you engage with it at their level, it's like, okay, here's the following proof. I think the best way to go about doing that would be like, okay, here's a proof for the resurrection. Go! Go! Um, like, oh, here's, here's a proof for the resurrection. You know, it's um, uh, here's the best case against the resurrection, which is, you know, here watch this Gavin Orland video, um, which is like, you know, uh, the grave theft plus illusion of hallucinations. Like the disciples stole the body and there was also some hallucination, collective hallucination and deception going on. Um, and show how that doesn't square up. I'm not gonna explain it now because that takes forever. Um, but like, you know, engage with them at that. But first of all, that's, uh, you kind of reach an intellectual barrier at that point, um, to where like, you kind of need to A, have a long period of time, B, an attention span that, like to the other person where like, they're actively engaging with this and they're act of like, you're not just handing them a tract or anything. And you're not just like saying a paragraph and then they come to Jesus. Like this is an intellectual discussion that you're having that takes place at the very least over like 10 minutes. Um, and that's if you keep their, um, attention, that's if they have the time. That's if they have the intellectual capacity to understand your argument. Um, that's if they have the historical knowledge to realize how we do history. Um, like there's, there's so much that you would need to explain. Um, and in order to do that, and even then, Christianity isn't intellectually believing that, um, like, it's true, you know? Christianity isn't intellectually believing that the resurrection happened. It's believing that the resurrection happened and he died for your sins and that you have sinned and that he took that penalty and that you can live only in Christ. Um, that's, you know, the gospel. Uh, and like, you know, there's a certain level of like heart. A certain level of spirituality, a certain level of, uh, swallowing your pride for it. What the fuck? Sorry, there's not a stop sign at that little spot, but he was acting as if it was a stop, which it should be a stop, frankly. Um, while there's traffic in the Culver's parking lot. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are we doing here? What's going on here? What are we doing? What are we doing? You can scoop the flip up. There we go. Look, look, look at us. Oh gosh. What's going on here, guys? What's going on? Sorry, I'm crashing out right now because it's really funny. Um, but what are we doing here? What are we doing here, guys? Is this is this really the freaking drive-through? Are we all in line for the drive-through? Are we all in line for the drive-through here? Is that what we're freaking doing? Are we all in line for the I I can't, I can't, I can't make this turn. What are we doing? What are we doing? Can I? Okay. Freaking a lot here. Let's go. Um, Okay, we're good. We're good. Horrible parking job, but that's kind of how I had to do this. Um, but yeah, I don't know. I didn't reach a conclusion there. I'm sorry. You need, uh, conclusion, you need to make people realize that, um, rationality, like pure rationality or pure 20th century hyper-modernism is not the way to do things. And it's, uh, ultimately foundationless, and you can't build anything off of it. Um, and you need to build an and something off of it. Uh, to be human and to function properly, and to live any sense of life. Uh, so you either make something up, or you look at something that seems to be real, you know? Um, I don't know."
